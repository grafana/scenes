Grafana Scenes is a simple and intuitive API that allows you quickly build experiences similar to Grafana Dashboards. Grafana Dashboards features, like querying and transformations, templating, time ranges, and more, are available in Grafana Scenes. Scenes is built with extensibility in mind so you can build your own Scene objects to provide custom behaviors.

If you want to play with Scenes right away, use [@grafana/create-plugin](https://github.com/grafana/plugin-tools/blob/main/packages/create-plugin/README.md).

To create a Scenes app, run the following command:

```console
npx @grafana/create-plugin@latest
```
