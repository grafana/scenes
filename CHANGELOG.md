**SceneObject subscribeToState parameter change**

Signature change. Now the parameter to this function expects a simple function that takes two args (newState, prevState).

Before:

```ts
this._subs.add(
  sourceData.subscribeToState({
    next: (state) => this.transform(state.data),
  })
);
```

Becomes:

```ts
this._subs.add(sourceData.subscribeToState((state) => this.transform(state.data)));
```

**addActivationHandler**

SceneObject now has a new function called addActivationHandler that makes it much easier to add external behaviors to core scene componenents. The 
activation handler (callback) can return a deactivation handler. This works very similar to useEffect.  

For custom components that used to override activate and then call super.activate() we now recommend that you instead use addActivationHandler from 
the constructor. See https://github.com/grafana/scenes/pull/77 for some examples.

**AppScenePage**

The getScene for drilldowns now expect the parent property to be of type AppScenePageLike (interface).

**SceneQueryRunner no longer has transformations**

Instead you have to use SceneDataTransformer and set its internal $data property to the SceneQueryRunner to get the same effect.

Example:

```tsx
 $data: new SceneDataTransformer({
    $data: new SceneQueryRunner({...}),
    transformations: [
      {
        id: 'reduce',
        options: {
          reducers: ['mean'],
        },
      },
    ],
  }),
```

SceneDataTransformer can still be used to transform parent scoped data, it will look for this if there is no $data property set.

The reasons for this change it to have more control over when only transformations should be re-processed (to not issue query again when only a dependency on the transforms changed).
It also removes some duplication between SceneQueryRunner and SceneDataTransformer. There is also a new interface SceneDataProvider.

```ts
export interface SceneDataProvider extends SceneObject<SceneDataState> {
  setContainerWidth?: (width: number) => void;
}
```
